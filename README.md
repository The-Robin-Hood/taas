# Tags as a Service (taas)

Tags as a Service (`taas`) is a Go-based project designed to provide a simple, scalable, and efficient tagging solution for your applications. Whether you need to organize, categorize, or filter data, `taas` makes it easy to add, manage, and query tags across your services.

## Features

- **RESTful Tag API:** Easily create, update, delete, and query tags via HTTP endpoints.
- **Flexible Tag Attachments:** Associate tags with any resource or entity.
- **Fast and Lightweight:** Built with Go for high performance and minimal resource usage.
- **Extensible Design:** Easy to integrate with existing systems and expand for custom needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.18 or higher

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/themythofsisyphus/taas.git
cd taas
```

Build the project:

```bash
go build -o taas
```

### Usage

Start the service:

```bash
./taas
```

By default, the service will start on port `8080`. You can configure this in the source code or with environment variables (see below).

#### API Endpoints

- `POST /tags` - Create a new tag
- `GET /tags` - List all tags
- `GET /tags/{id}` - Get a specific tag
- `PUT /tags/{id}` - Update a tag
- `DELETE /tags/{id}` - Delete a tag
- `POST /attach` - Attach tags to resources
- `GET /resource/{id}/tags` - List tags for a specific resource

#### Configuration

You can configure the service via environment variables:

- `PORT` - The port to run the service on (default: 8080)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string if persistence is enabled

## Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tags -d '{"name": "golang"}'
```
